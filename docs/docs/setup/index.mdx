# Setup

To setup **Jupyter MCP Server**, you need to:

1. [Set up your environment](#environment-setup)
2. [Start JupyterLab](#start-jupyterlab)
3. [Configure your preferred MCP client](#configuration).

Jupyter MCP Server supports both [stdio](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/basic/transports#stdio) and [streamable HTTP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/basic/transports#streamable-http) transports.

Alternative: You can also use [Smithery](#installing-via-smithery) to install Jupyter MCP Server automatically for your preferred client.

## Environment

Make sure you have the following packages installed in your environment. The collaboration package is needed as the modifications made on the notebook can be seen thanks to [Jupyter Real Time Collaboration](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/rtc.html).

```bash
pip install jupyterlab==4.4.1 jupyter-collaboration==4.0.2 ipykernel
pip uninstall -y pycrdt datalayer_pycrdt
pip install datalayer_pycrdt==0.12.17
```

## Start JupyterLab

Then, start JupyterLab with the following command.

```bash
jupyter lab --port 8888 --IdentityProvider.token MY_TOKEN --ip 0.0.0.0
```

You can also run `make jupyterlab` if you cloned the repository.

:::note
The `--ip` is set to `0.0.0.0` to allow the MCP server running in a Docker container to access your local JupyterLab.

## Configuration

### Stdio Transport

Use the following configuration file to set up the Jupyter MCP Server for your preferred MCP client.
Note that the configuration is dependent on the operating system you are using.

:::important

Ensure the `port` of the `SERVER_URL`and `TOKEN` match those used in the `jupyter lab` command.

The `NOTEBOOK_PATH` should be relative to the directory where JupyterLab was started.

#### MacOS and Windows

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "jupyter": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "-i",
        "--rm",
        "-e",
        "SERVER_URL",
        "-e",
        "TOKEN",
        "-e",
        "NOTEBOOK_PATH",
        "datalayer/jupyter-mcp-server:latest"
      ],
      "env": {
        "SERVER_URL": "http://host.docker.internal:8888",
        "TOKEN": "MY_TOKEN",
        "NOTEBOOK_PATH": "notebook.ipynb"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Linux

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "jupyter": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "-i",
        "--rm",
        "-e",
        "SERVER_URL",
        "-e",
        "TOKEN",
        "-e",
        "NOTEBOOK_PATH",
        "--network=host",
        "datalayer/jupyter-mcp-server:latest"
      ],
      "env": {
        "SERVER_URL": "http://localhost:8888",
        "TOKEN": "MY_TOKEN",
        "NOTEBOOK_PATH": "notebook.ipynb"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Streamable HTTP Transport

Jupyter MCP Servers also supports streamable HTTP transport, which allows you to connect to the Jupyter MCP Server using a URL. To start the server, you can either use `python` or `docker`. The server will listen on port `4040`, you can access it via http://localhost:4040.

#### Python

Clone the repository and use `pip install -e .` or just install the `jupyter-mcp-server package` from PyPI with `pip install jupyter-mcp-server`. Then, you can start the Jupyter MCP Server with the following command:

```bash
python -m jupyter-mcp-server --transport streamable_http
```

#### Docker

You can also run the Jupyter MCP Server using Docker. Use the following command to start the server:

```bash
docker run -p 4040:4040 datalayer/jupyter-mcp-server:latest --transport streamable-http
```

:::note
You can set the `SERVER_URL` (JupyterLab Server URL), `TOKEN`, and `NOTEBOOK_PATH` environment variables to configure the server with the `-e` option in the `docker run` command. If not set, the defaults will be used:
- `SERVER_URL`: `http://host.docker.internal:8888`
- `TOKEN`: `MY_TOKEN`
- `NOTEBOOK_PATH`: `notebook.ipynb`

## Install via Smithery

To install Jupyter MCP Server for Claude Desktop automatically via [Smithery](https://smithery.ai/server/@datalayer/jupyter-mcp-server):

```bash
npx -y @smithery/cli install @datalayer/jupyter-mcp-server --client claude
```
